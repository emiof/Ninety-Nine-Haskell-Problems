# Ninety-Nine-Haskell-Problems
Solutions to the Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems (https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems), which are based on Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems, written by Werner Hett. The solutions for each problem are written in both Haskell and Python. 

This is a didactic exercise intended mainly to prompt through practice a greater grasp of the Haskell programming language, the functional programming paradigm, and the language's idiosyncratic principles and forms that distinguish it from other multi-paradigm languages, such as Python.
